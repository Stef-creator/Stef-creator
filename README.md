## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stefan â€” a passionate programmer and lifelong tinkerer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed figuring out how things work and building upon them, whether through code, data, or design. ðŸ˜Š

A bit about my background: I hold a BSc and MSc in Mathematical Economics from Copenhagen Business School, as well as a Masterâ€™s degree in Law, Economics, and Management from a consortium of universities in Paris.

Right now, Iâ€™m in the process of uploading a backlog of personal and academic projects â€” feel free to check back soon to see whatâ€™s new!
